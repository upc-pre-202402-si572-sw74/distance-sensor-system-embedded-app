# distance-sensor-system-embedded-app

## Summary
This project is an embedded system application that uses a distance sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and an object. The application is implemented on a STM32F407VG microcontroller using the STM32CubeIDE. The application uses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and an object. The distance is displayed on an LCD screen.

## Language and Programming Approach
Object-Oriented C++.

## Hardware
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LCD Display
